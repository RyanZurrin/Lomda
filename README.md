# Lomda
Lomda is a mathematically inspired programming language designed to be easily readable and mathematically useful.
The language is able to implicitly perform a number of operations, ranging from addition to differential calculus.
It also comes with a type system that can be used to verify some of the safety of the language.

## Installation
On a Unix-based system, the source can be built using `make`. Simply run it in the main directory to generate the `lomda` executable.

## Usage
