# Lomda
Lomda is a mathematically inspired programming language designed to be easily readable and mathematically useful. The language is able to implicitly perform a number of operations, ranging from addition to differential calculus.

## Installation
On a Unix-based system, the source can be built using `make`. Simply run it in the main directory to generate the `lomda` executable.

## Usage
Lomda offers the ability to run either as a line-by-line interpreter or as an executor. The following are supported usages of the executable:
```
$ ./lomda
$ ./lomda source.lom
```

## Docs
Documentation for the language is still a work in progress. The endgame is to establish a wiki to contain tutorials and examples of how to use ambiguous features.

## Credits
Lomda was created by Christopher Hittner
